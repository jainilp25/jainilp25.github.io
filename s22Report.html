      I am Jainil Patel, a 3th year Computer Science (Co-op) student. This is
      my second work term report on my experience working at CIBC - US Wealth
      Private Management from May 2022 to Aug 2022. I would like to share a few
      things about my employer, responsibilities, accomplishments, and the
      skills I have developed over the 4 months.

      <h2 class="section-title">About the Employer</h2>

      Two of the largest banks in Canadian history merged on June 1, 1961 -
      The Canadian Bank of Commerce (established 1867) and the Imperial Bank
      of Canada (established 1875) to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of
      Commerce (CIBC).

      The above picture is the newly developed CIBC Square. It is one of the tallest full-glass
      offices in Toronto with a direct view of the CN Tower, city skyline, and Lake Ontario. I
      had an amazing time working there. It was a pleasure meeting my co-workers in person, as
      well as getting to experience the office environment and etiquette.

      <h2 class="section-title">Job Description & Project Overview</h2>
      As a Production Application Support Analyst at CIBC, my job was to help
      develop new features and maintain existing ones for the ORS application
      - a request system - used by portfolio managers. Occasionally, I also
      worked with the business team for planning and the QA team for testing
      pre-production features.
      <br />
      <br />
      My first major task working for the US Wealth Management Team was to
      help migrate existing code from a manual deployment process to using an
      automated pipeline in Azure Devops. During the migration, I also assited
      in chosing a version control tool (GIT vs TFS) using a benefits report
      and a live demo. When multiple developers simultaniously work on large
      application with thousands of lines of code, it is important to keep
      track of changes and merge them accordingly.
      <br />
      <br />
      Throughout the 4-month work term, I developed, tested, and maintained
      various different features on the ORS application at CIBC. These
      features included dynamic request form selection on the homepage,
      addition of account closing form, as well as modification of various
      existing forms as per product owner's request. A strict procedure is to
      be followed for any creation, modification, or deletion of forms. One
      must follow the guidelines set by the business team, program in C# and
      .NET, make necessary changes in the SQL database, get the feature tested
      by QA team and finally it is ready for deployment. I was lucky to
      experience all steps of the deployment process.
      <br />
      <br />
      I was also given the wonderful opportunity to work with two other
      aspects of the development cycle - planning and testing. I worked with
      senior Business Analysts to gather requirements for a feature and design
      its User Interface accordingly. These requirements and design was used
      by other developers for their work. Once the coding portion of the
      feature was complete, I worked with the Quality Assurance team to
      thoroughly test the feature considering all aspects of the user's
      workflow. I was able to learn new tools and frameworks used to designing
      and testing and application.
      <br />
      <br />
      Ultimately, I got to work on many different features for the ORS
      application throughout my work term. I also led the migration to
      Microsoft Azure DevOps pipelines to automatically deploy any code
      changes. Moving from manual deployment of code to automated immensely
      saved time for developers and it also reduced errors in package
      bundeling. Alongside developing programming skills, I am grateful I was
      able to improve some of my soft skills as well such as teamwork,
      communication, and time management. Although working remotely was a
      unique challenge, I was able to go into the office once a week which
      provided a necessary change in my work environment.

      <h2 class="section-title">Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
      <h4>Build Confidence Communicating to Large Groups</h4>
      I have never been great at presenting or speaking to large groups, so I
      wanted to build my confidence during this work term, especially in front
      of senior members and clients. The daily team meetings ranging from standups,
      sprint planning, and demos really helped
      in achieving this goal as I occasionally lead the standups.
      I was able to practice speaking in an organized manner
      communicating to several attendees. I was also given the opportunity to
      demonstrate my projects at our weekly demo meeting in front of
      approximately 20 members from various different teams (DEVS, BA and QA). At the end of my
      work term, I was much more confident speaking to large groups of people
      and successfully presenting my work to clients and stakeholders.

      <h4>Gain Knowledge of Business Concepts</h4>
      When I started my work term at CIBC, I had little to no business knowledge.
      Being a part of the US Private Wealth Management team, it was necessary for me
      to have basic information about business terms and concepts. My manager provided
      me with resources to learn the required information using web readings and a
      glossary docuemnt. I thoroughly read through the articles and documents to strengthen
      my understanding. This knowledge was very helpful when working with clients and
      stakeholders. I believe I was successful in this goal as I was able to comfortably
      communicate with business clients. I was also able to utilize this knowledge during
      the developement state to fulfil client requirements.

      <h4>Learn Databases for Application Development</h4>
      At the start of my work term, I was fairly new to SQL work as well as the
      SQL Management Studio. The SQL language is very popular and
      widely used in the software development industry. Learning this
      is extremely crucial for any programmer as it is common way of data storage.
      Since SQL databases were used as a primary way of storing client data at CIBC,
      it was a great opportunity for me to learn. To strengthen my understanding
      and apply my knowledge of the language, I was given tasks that met this criteria.
      I worked on various features that directly used SQL and the Management Studio or a
      variation of the application. Towards the end of the work term, I was
      very comfortable working in this development environment having gained
      experience through application development and testing.

      <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
      Overall, my 4-month work term at CIBC was extremely successful. I was
      familiar with Azure DevOps, C#, and .NET however, I was motivated to
      learn new things and work hard. I am satisfied with all that I
      accomplished. I was able to learn the aforementioned new technologies as
      well as improve the ones I already knew like HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and
      SQL. My time working in the US Private Wealth Management team allowed me
      to understand about the industry and the working environment. I am
      thankful for the opportunity I was given which made me a better
      programmer, speaker, and overall strengthened my individual skills.
