      <h2 class="section-title">Introduction</h2>
      I am Jainil Patel, a 3rd year Computer Science (Co-op) student, minoring in Statistics. This is my first work term
      report on my experience working at the University of Guelph - Computer & Communications Services from May to
      December 2021. I would like to share a few things about my employer, responsibilities, accomplishments, and the
      skills I have developed over the 8 months.

      <h2 class="section-title">About the Employer</h2>
      Computer & Communications Services (CCS) is a department at the University of Guelph, providing a wide range of IT
      and communication solutions to the university community. The provided services range from computer and server
      support, email and calendaring tools, software downloads, file storage and databases, as well as web hosting and
      web development help.

      In 1969, the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) was created to operate the IBM mainframe computer and support
      administrative computing applications. After several years of providing services and innovating new tools for the
      university community, ICS migrates to Computing and Communications Services (CCS). Since 1992, CCS has been an
      important part of the University of Guelph.

      <h2 class="section-title">Job Description & Project Overview</h2>
      As a Junior Analyst at CCS, my job was to help develop and maintain software for the finance team as well as the
      University of Guelph treasury department clients. Occasionally, I also tested and debugged applications for the
      student team and the human resources team.
      <br>
      <br>
      My first major task working at CCS was researching the front-end web component framework, Lit. The Polymer
      framework, currently being used in CCS applications, is no longer supported by Google and the team of developers
      was in search of a new framework to migrate to. I researched the new framework, tested the creation of web
      components, and documented my process in a report format to present to the entire team of developers at CCS.
      <br>
      <br>
      Throughout the 8-month work term, I developed, tested, and maintained various different applications across the
      four teams at CCS; Finance, Student, HR, and Research. A previously developed application, MAD, which converts CSV
      files into a more readable and organized Excel document started to have minor issues. I worked with the client
      directly to resolve the issue and document the solution for future debugging.
      <br>
      <br>
      I was also given the wonderful opportunity to work with two other developers in the Finance team to create the RRV
      application for the Treasury department. I helped create the PDF functionality for the application using the
      Speedata framework. This included designing the template for downloadable PDF documents, data entry, as well
      merging multiple PDFs into one file. I gained lots of knowledge in PDF template creation during the development of
      this application while also researching deployment configurations.
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, I was given an individual project to be completed for in-house usage. An inventory application for CCS
      members to track loaned hardware, software, and licenses. I was really excited to create this application as the
      technology stack being used was completely new to me. This was an opportunity to learn new languages and
      frameworks as well as participate in the deployment process. I demonstrated the application and received feedback
      from CCS members at different stages of the development phase.
      <br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, I got to work on many different applications throughout my work term. I also had some exposure to
      Microsoft Azure DevOps to create PBIs. These PBIs helped track work from our team’s bi-weekly sprints, and the
      migration of applications from on-premise to the cloud. Alongside developing programming skills, I am grateful I
      was able to improve some of my soft skills as well such as teamwork, communication, and time management. Although
      working remotely was a unique challenge, I was able to adapt to the schedule. This also meant separating my
      personal and professional life.

      <h2 class="section-title">Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
      <h4>Build Confidence Communicating to Large Groups</h4>
      I have never been great at presenting or speaking to large groups, so I wanted to build my confidence during this
      work term, especially in front of senior members and clients. The daily stand-up meetings really helped in
      achieving this goal as I occasionally lead the meeting on my Finance team. I was able to practice speaking in an
      organized manner communicating to several attendees. I was also given the opportunity to demonstrate my projects
      at our bi-weekly .NET meeting in front of approximately 15 members from various different teams. At the end of my
      work term, I was much more confident speaking to large groups of people and successfully presenting my work to
      clients and stakeholders.
      <h4>Improve Organization and Time Management Skills</h4>
      When I started my work term at CCS, one of my struggles was organization and time management skills. I’ve been
      accustomed to being given assignment instructions and deadlines in university classes. However, in this work
      environment, I was given a task to complete for which I would need to research the necessary technologies needed
      and refer to any useful resources. I realized that I would need to improve my organizational and time management
      skills in order to complete the task successfully and efficiently. I succeeded at this by using Azure DevOps
      Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to track my outstanding and completed work. I created sub-tasks within PBIs to split
      a large work item into smaller portions to complete. I used Trello to keep track of deadlines and assist with my
      time management goal. With the usage of Azure DevOps PBIs and Trello I was able to organize tasks in a time based
      manner while documenting the process for my co-workers.
      <h4>Learn C# and .NET Core for Application Development</h4>
      At the start of my work term, I was completely new to C# and .NET Core development. The language and framework
      combination is very popular and widely used in the software development industry. Learning this technology stack
      can be very beneficial for a programmer. Since C# and .NET Core is often used at CCS, it was a great opportunity
      for me to learn. To strengthen my understanding and apply my knowledge of the language and framework, I was given
      tasks that met this criteria. I worked on various applications that directly used C# and .NET Core or a variation
      of the combination. Towards the end of the work term, I was very comfortable working in this development
      environment having gained experience through application development and testing.

      <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
      Overall, my 8-month work term at the University of Guelph - CCS was extremely successful. Azure DevOps, C#, and
      .NET Core were all new to me however, I was motivated to learn and work hard. I am satisfied with all that I
      accomplished. I was able to learn the aforementioned new technologies as well as improve the ones I already knew
      like HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. My time working in the Finance team allowed me to understand about the
      industry and the working environment. I am thankful for the opportunity I was given which made me a better
      programmer, speaker, and overall strengthened my individual skills.
