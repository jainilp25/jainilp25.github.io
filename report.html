        I am Jainil Patel, a 3rd year Computer Science (Co-op) student, minoring
        in Statistics. This is my first work term report on my experience
        working at the University of Guelph - Computer & Communications Services
        from May to December 2021. I would like to share a few things about my
        employer, responsibilities, accomplishments, and the skills I have
        developed over the 8 months.

        Computer & Communications Services (CCS) is a department at the
        University of Guelph, providing a wide range of IT and communication
        solutions to the university community. The provided services range from
        computer and server support, email and calendaring tools, software
        downloads, file storage and databases, as well as web hosting and web
        development help.
        <br />
        <br />
        In 1969, the Institute of Computer Science (ICS) was created to operate
        the IBM mainframe computer and support administrative computing
        applications. After several years of providing services and innovating
        new tools for the university community, ICS migrates to Computing and
        Communications Services (CCS). Since 1992, CCS has been an important
        part of the University of Guelph.

        <h2 class="section-title">Learning Goals & Reflections</h2>
        <h4>Build Confidence Communicating to Large Groups</h4>
        I have never been great at presenting or speaking to large groups, so I
        wanted to build my confidence during this work term, especially in front
        of senior members and clients. The daily stand-up meetings really helped
        in achieving this goal as I occasionally lead the meeting on my finance
        team. I was able to practice speaking in an organized manner. I was also
        given the opportunity to present my work and demo my projects at our
        bi-weekly .NET meeting in front of approximately 25 attendees. At the
        end of my work term, I was much more confident speaking to large groups
        of people and successfully presenting my work to clients and
        stakeholders.
        <h4>Improve Organization and Time Management Skills</h4>
        When I started my work term at CCS, I was a bit overwhelmed by the
        individual work. Iâ€™ve been accustomed to being given assignment
        instructions in university classes and being provided with resources to
        complete the work. However, in this work environment, I was given a task
        to complete and I would need to research the necessary technologies on
        my own as well as find resources to help complete the task. I realized
        that I would need to improve my organizational and time management
        skills in order to complete the task successfully and efficiently. I
        succeeded at this by creating Azure DevOps Product Backlog Items (PBIs)
        to organize my tasks. I also used Trello to keep track of my work
        completion and deadlines to assist with my time management goal. With
        the usage of Azure DevOps PBIs and Trello I was consistently completing
        tasks while documenting the process for my co-workers.
